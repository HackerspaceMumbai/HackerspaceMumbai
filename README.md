# Hackerspace Mumbai

## ‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞ üôè

We are Mumbai's largest independent tech community who have been organizing the city's longest-running tech meetup (over nine years).

## So what we do AND why?

Our goal is to widen and deepen the sense of internet citizenship of the city's residents. And benefits society and have fun while doing it. Good Karma. üòÄ

We do this through 3 initiatives:

1. **[Mumbai Technology Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Mumbai-Technology-Meetup/)**: We host a minimum of one meetup a month dedicated to technologies [mostly #OSS] where our target audience is intermediate developers. **#mumtechup**

1. **[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)**: We are one of the earliest fCC boot camps in India, providing a supportive community for folks beginning to code.

1. **[ProtoSchool](https://proto.school/)**: We are proud to support a "decentralized" web and host meetups where folks can learn technologies for Web3.
