# Hackerspace Mumbai

## ‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞ üôè

We are Mumbai's largest independent tech community who have been organizing the city's longest-running tech meetup (over nine years).

## So what we do AND why?

Our goal is to widen and deepen the access to knowledge & technology, coupled with installing a sense of internet citizenship. Hopefully, we can help folks around the world and have fun while doing it. Earn a lot of...good Karma.üòÄ

We do this through 3 initiatives:

1. **[Mumbai Technology Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Mumbai-Technology-Meetup/)**: We host a minimum of one meetup a month dedicated to technologies [mostly #OSS] where our target audience is intermediate developers. **#mumtechup**

1. **[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)**: We are one of the earliest fCC boot camps in India, providing a supportive community for folks beginning to code.

1. **[ProtoSchool](https://proto.school/)**: We are proud to support a "decentralized" web and host meetups where folks can learn technologies for **#Web3**.
