Welcome to the Mumbai "chapter" üòä of [ProtoSchool](https://proto.school) where we learn, share and master the decentralized web üíªprotocols. Get familiar with esoteric acronyms & terms like IPFS [Interplanetary File System], Filecoin, libp2p etc via interactive tutorials and collaborate with fellow enthusiasts on projects that make a difference.

***Decentralizers of the world, assemble [max... once a month üòÅ]***

Join us for our first meetup on 16th Feb 2019.

## Organizers

Hackerspace Mumbai, the city's largest #OSS community, will be running the chapter as part of their monthly Mumbai Technology Meetup [#mumtechup]. The mandate of the community is to increase and enhance internet citizenship amongst its denizen and also give an opportunity to techies to contribute to the society at large. Proto.school will be one of the initiative along with#freecodecamp where newbies are taught to be full stack developer & #netsquare where techies help to mentor non-profits and NGOs.
