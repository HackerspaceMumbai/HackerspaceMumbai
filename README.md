# ProtoSchool Mumbai

 ‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§Ç‡§¨‡§à üôè.

Welcome to the Mumbai "chapter" üòä of the [ProtoSchool](https://proto.school) in which we learn, with interactive tutorials, decentralized web protocols.

## Organizers

Hackerspace Mumbai, the city's largest #OSS community, will be conducting the tutorials as part of their monthly Mumbai Technology Meetup [#mumtechup]. The mandate of the group is to increase and enhance internet citizenship amongst its denizen and also give an opportunity to techies to contribute to the society at large. Proto.school will be one of the initiative along #freecodecamp where newbies are taught to be full stack developer & #netsquared where techies help to mentor non-profits and NGOs.
