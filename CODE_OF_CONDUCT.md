# ProtoSchool Mumbai Code of Conduct

_TODO: 
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, please create a Code of Conduct for 
your repository, website (if applicable), and events. Some good templates that you may consider as a 
starting point include the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) and the 
[Conference Code of Conduct](http://confcodeofconduct.com/). Be sure to adapt these to your own 
chapter's needs and procedures (for example, statements about how attendees can identify organizers 
at events). Be sure to **include contact information and a procedure for reporting any incidents to 
chapter leadership**._
